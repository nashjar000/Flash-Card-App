# Overview

For this project, I wanted to furhter my understanding of the Swift language and build an iOS app in at least 10 hours with 100 lines of code or more. 

This is a simple flash card app that users can use to create flashcard sets for various subjects to study from on their iPhones. 

My purpose for creating this app was to gain experince and understadning of programing a mobile app.

# Development Environment
I used x-code as the main platform for bulding this project. X-code is an platform from Apple that iOS users can use to program and write iOS applications.  

The language I used to write this app was swift. Swift is a language that can be used to make iOS apps. For this project, I used it to make an iPhone app.

* [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)

# Future Work
* Have the tasks save to the app so that a user can go back to it after closing the app.
* Delete a flashcard or a set
* View all flash cards
* Create a multiple-choice quiz from the flash cards for users to test themselves.
